<h2>I</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">THROUGH the chill rain of the
December twilight a train
crept slowly up the valley like
a storm-beaten glow-worm, its single
Pullman passenger a woman, youthful
and yet mature, whose beauty was
marred by indefinable shadows in the
beautiful gray eyes and hard and bitter
lines about the mouth. It had been a
long and tiresome journey through a sodden
world roofed with a marquee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mist; three days of cloud and rain from
her lonely home in Denver to the goal
ahead, an unfamiliar village of which
her hazy mental picture had been inspired
by the imagery of a friend.</div>

<p>A ruined mill with dripping eaves, a
grinding shudder of brakes, and the train
halted. With quick interest in her eyes,
the traveler alighted, but outside on the
sodden village platform her interest fled
panic-stricken in an overpowering
surge of loneliness and dismay. Surely,
surely, thought Jean Varian, a bleak
enough goal for her odd caprice! Great,
wind-beaten trees dripped above the village
and the covered bridge; fog-ridden
hills towered in the distance like ghostly
gables of the valley; and at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the street in the old-fashioned hotel to
which days before she had whimsically
written for rooms, only a single unpromising
light flickered dully through the
wind and rain.</p>

<p>But the night was settling rapidly and
with a careless direction to the staring
baggageman, Jean Varian turned away
into the muddy street and made her way
to the hotel where a man in boots with
a bucket in his hand was stumping
heavily away from the pump to the long,
low hitching sheds beyond.</p>

<p>It was essentially rural in its homely
comfort, the Westowe House, with
brightly colored cornucopias in the parlor
carpet and hair-cloth parlor furniture
blotched with tidies that tobogganed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dizzily to the floor at a touch; but Mrs.
Pryce, the proprietor's wife, was stout
and ruddy and so frankly and intimately
curious that Jean kept to her room for
the greater part of the day that followed.</p>

<p>The rain continued. Outside, the stable-man
tramped noisily about among
the steaming horses, the pump creaked
under frequent duress; Mrs. Pryce was
insistently hospitable and insistently
curious; and at twilight, appalled by the
dreary monotony of it all, Jean restlessly
set forth to explore the village. It was
already dark when in her careless circuit
she approached the railroad. The night
train was puffing leisurely past the
sheep-pen and a man was tramping toward
the post-office with a mail-bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
over his shoulder. Ahead with a promise
of further monotony and curiosity
flickered the lights of the Westowe
House. Jean's footsteps lagged.</p>

<p>Now just behind the station, parallel
with the glistening rails, lay a country
lane, and down this, in the heart of the
rain and dark, twinkled a single light so
cheerful and inviting that Jean halted
unconsciously. Vaguely she remembered
having caught its elfin glimmer
the night before, but now as she watched,
it twinkled so irresistibly with an inferential
atmosphere of warmth and cheer
that the girl gathered her wet cloak
about her and set off toward it in a pleasant
glow of curiosity.</p>

<p>A smell of wet pine filled the lane, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
though the way was very dark and a
little lonely, Jean Varian hurried on,
halting at last with a smothered sigh of
envy. For here in the heart of the dripping
pine-trees, lay a tiny cottage, so
white and trim and cheery that even the
croon of the gallant pines that brushed
the roof bore in it nothing of the
night's melancholy. Now the light that
twinkled among the pine-needles and
the rain-glisten of the night came from
a lamp held through an open porch-window
from within by the hand of a tiny
woman with a shawl about her head, and
even as Jean stared wonderingly, the
watcher in the window spoke.</p>

<p>"<i>Good</i> evening!" she called brightly.
"It is so very windy and wet to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Perhaps I can persuade you to step in
and have a cup of hot tea with me!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," stammered Jean from the
rain and shadows, "I&mdash;I did not dream
you could see me!"</p>

<p>"Why, neither I can, my dear!" briskly
replied the little woman, "but many a
cold and weary straggler from the night
train sees my light and whenever I call
there is, as a rule, an answer! And
now,"&mdash;with an energetic cordiality
wonderfully compelling&mdash;"if you will
please come straight up the walk and
open the front door, you'll find a fire
and a welcome just as warm. Why,
bless your tired heart," she added with a
quick, birdlike turn of her muffled head
that brought the light upon her face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"my kettle is singing away here like a
cricket. Do hurry!"</p>

<p>Wonderingly, Jean obeyed. Who
could withstand the irresistible warmth
of the little woman's hospitality? And
with the opening of the cottage door, the
astonished guest left all the chill and
melancholy of the winter night behind
her, for here in a snugly-curtained room
roared a rollicking, jovial blade of a
wood-fire, waggishly throwing the reflection
of his ever-busy fire-sword upon
the old-fashioned walls and checkerboard
carpet, the oval portraits and the
snowy supper cloth, trimly decked in
china blue, all the while filling the room
with his boisterous crackles and chuckles
of delight! And steaming madly away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in spirited rivalry over an alcohol blaze,
a handsome brass kettle, ludicrously fat
and complacent, hummed a throaty jubilate
of self-approval. Surely the splendid
emperor of all kettles! thought Jean
Varian, smiling, this exuberant egotist
with his polished armor and his plume
of steam!</p>

<p>"And such a vain fellow, too, my
dear!" chirped an amused voice at Jean's
elbow, "but then he's such a very cheerful
comrade I forgive him that!" and the
girl starting, found herself smiling
warmly down into the face of her hostess.</p>

<p>And what a tiny hostess she was to be
sure, quite as trim and picturesque in her
white woolen gown as the cottage itself.
Snow-white, too, her hair, framing a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
old face with eyes of china blue, eyes so
bright and friendly that Jean unconsciously
likened them to the light among
the pines. And like the odor of pine
about the cottage, an aura of cheeriness
hovered about the owner.</p>

<p>Now presently, as the hospitable little
woman went bustling about, intent upon
the comfort of her unknown guest in the
chair by the fire, Jean saw with a sudden
husk in her throat that this cheerful little
hostess of hers was very lame; that wherever
she went a tiny crutch, half-hidden
beneath a fold of her gown, went tap!
tap! tapping! steadily along, as
sprightly and energetic a crutch as one
might find, and somehow the bitterness
in the traveler's eyes softened at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sight of it and her beautiful face warmed
into kindliness.</p>

<p>"Do please let me help you!" she
begged suddenly. And so these two
women, brought together by the whim
of the one and the kindliness of the other
and perhaps by a floating strand of Fate,
worked busily together over the making
of the tea, the one with the unaccustomed
hands of the aristocrat; the other
with the deft experience of cheerful self-dependence.</p>

<p>Tap! tap! tap! went the crutch about
the room; drip! drip! drip! the rain
among the pines; the steaming Emperor
hummed and the fire chuckled and in the
midst of it all, the hostess suddenly
halted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my dear," she exclaimed, with
swift color in her wrinkled cheeks, "the
very foolish folk of Westowe call me
Aunt Cheerful and I'd like to have you
do the same, for although it's a very foolish
name indeed, still I'm only a very
foolish old woman and I'm very fond of
it."</p>

<p>Aunt Cheerful! Jean glanced at the
slight figure leaning lightly upon her
crutch with a sudden mist across her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful it shall be indeed!"
she said gently.</p>

<p>"And my lane here they call Pine Tree
Lane, because at either end you may
catch the pleasant odor of my pines.
And the cottage&mdash;well, what else could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it be, my dear, but Pine Tree Cottage!"</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse Aunt Cheerful
crossed the room with a quick tap!
tap! of her crutch and laid a small hand
impulsively upon Jean's arm.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said wistfully, "you'll
pardon a lonely old woman her frankness?
I've taken a very great fancy to
you! Why not stay to supper with
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" protested Jean quickly;
"I&mdash;you are too kind!" She glanced at
the little supper table set for three and
Aunt Cheerful smiled.</p>

<p>"Only a foolish fancy!" she nodded.
"In reality, my dear, I live alone, quite
alone!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>And later, her protests engulfed in the
hubbub of calming the indignant Emperor
sputtering fussily over this unprecedented
neglect, Jean came to learn
more fully of this "foolish fancy."
Quietly Aunt Cheerful added a fourth
place at the table and with ready tact
Jean slipped into it unquestioning.</p>

<p>"My dear," exclaimed Aunt Cheerful
quickly, "I thank you!" then, catching
the warm friendliness and sympathy in
the eyes of her guest, she colored.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," she burst forth,
"never, never was there such a foolish
old woman as I. I'm sure you will not
laugh at me if I tell you that the plate
just opposite is always set for my busy
son in the far West. And lonely nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
like this when the rain drips through the
pines or the snow polka-dots the lane
and the ghostly wind comes rattling my
windows, I like to pretend that he's there
in his chair, big and gallant and handsome
as always, and then I&mdash;I sometimes
talk aloud to him and pass him the
dishes I know he likes. Just a foolish
mother's game," she added, flushing
hotly, "and I&mdash;I do not know why it is
I have told you my weakness. Surely,"
with quick apology, "you must think me
very silly indeed!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" cried Jean, an odd
catch in her voice, "I think it is all very
beautiful!" and Aunt Cheerful's face
grew radiant.</p>

<p>"Do you indeed!" she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
beaming. "Well, now, I <i>am</i> pleased.
I've always feared it was very weak and
silly!" Then, suddenly struck by the
rich color in her guest's cheeks and the
wonderful gentleness that had magically
obscured the shadows in the girl's
fine eyes, she added delightedly, "Why,
how refreshed you are looking, child!
Dear me, I do believe I'll keep you over
night. No, not a word, my dear! Just
hear the rain and the wind. Why bless
your heart, that's answer enough!"</p>

<h2>II</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">THE Emperor retired with a
drowsy bubble; the busy Fire-blusterer
astride the smouldering
log replaced his sword of flame in
a sheath of embers, and Aunt Cheerful's
room settled into shadowy quiet with
only the sleepy glow of the fire to light
it. By the window, blocked from the
room by a screen, a lamp sent its bright
rays through the pines to light the dark
of the lane beyond.</div>

<p>"And now," exclaimed Aunt Cheerful
from her chair by the fire, "is the time,
my dear, when I always see my Lady of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Fireglow in her flame-colored satin!
Jewels of fire flash about her throat and
hair, and very beautiful she is too, I
fancy, though to be sure I am never able
to catch a glimpse of her face!" Aunt
Cheerful smiled across the firelit hearth
at the shadowy figure of her guest.
"And the third place at the table," she
owned wistfully, "is always for her, for
somehow to me she is the fire's promise of
the kind and beautiful wife who may
one day come into my big son's life and
therefore into mine!"</p>

<p>The clock above the mantel struck
nine and to Jean's astonishment a window
beside the screen was suddenly
raised from the porch side and a boy's
head and shoulders appeared, plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
visible in the fan of light from the hidden
lamp. Not a very large boy&mdash;surely
a scant dozen years lay behind
him!&mdash;but a strangely self-possessed
little chap nevertheless, with damp,
waving hair, a grim little chin, and
cheeks as rosy as the apple of health
itself.</p>

<p>Now as Jean watched from her
shadowy corner, the boy carefully
shifted his oil-skin packet of papers,
seated himself upon the window sill and
doffed his dripping cap with the air of
a court gallant. And mortal ears never
heard a stranger conversation.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Lady Cheerful!" he
said deferentially, his grave brown eyes
seeking the spot by the fire where Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Cheerful's white woolen gown glimmered
faintly in the firelight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">

<div class="caption">The boy seated himself upon the window-sill and doffed

</div>

<p>"Why, good evening, Lord Chesterfield!"
returned Aunt Cheerful, a wonderful
warmth and affection in her
voice; "I trust I see you well this evening,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed, I thank you,
ma'am! I trust," he added very politely,
"that your Ladyship is enjoying
good health?"</p>

<p>"I am indeed. May I venture to ask
your Lordship how you have found business
this evening?"</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield looked gravely at
the dripping oilskin.</p>

<p>"The night is very wet," he admitted,
"and business poor!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear, dear! What a pity!"</p>

<p>"But, as usual, I have given myself
the honor of stopping at the post-office
for your Ladyship's mail."</p>

<p>"Kindly and courteous and thoughtful
as ever!" nodded Aunt Cheerful.
Lord Chesterfield's cheeks reddened with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"There was nothing!" he said regretfully.
"Now as to the news"&mdash;frowning
thoughtfully&mdash;"Mrs. Bobbins' twins
have the measles."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I <i>am</i> sorry!" exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful sympathetically.</p>

<p>"And Grandmother Radcliffe's cow
'pears to be growing more mopey and
blue each day. She bellows terrible
mournful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't imagine," mused Aunt Cheerful,
"what <i>can</i> be the matter with that
poor cow!"</p>

<p>"The strange lady at the hotel went
walking to-night in the rain and she's
not back yet. Most likely she's gone
a-visitin'."</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Aunt Cheerful.</p>

<p>"And then"&mdash;Lord Chesterfield
cleared his throat&mdash;"I wouldn't tell you
this, ma'am, but your Ladyship would
surely ask me. I'm sorry to have to tell
you that there's another leak in that roof
of mine."</p>

<p>"Another leak! Oh, my dear boy!"
exclaimed Aunt Cheerful in dismay,
startled out of her court manners by her
quick solicitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is nothing, madam, I assure you!"
urged Lord Chesterfield gallantly, "I've
got mos' a pound of chewin' gum from
the boys to mend it with. They took up
a chewing gum subscription," he added
gratefully.</p>

<p>"Lord Chesterfield," said Aunt Cheerful
very soberly, "I'm afraid you'll have
to give up that hermit hut of yours. It's
growing very leaky! You've thought
over very, very carefully that proposition
of coming to live with me?"</p>

<p>"Very carefully, ma'am, I thank you!"
said Lord Chesterfield firmly. "I'm
afraid I prefer to stay a bachelor."</p>

<p>"And may I venture a question concerning
the health of your Lordship's
many patients?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"All doing nicely, ma'am, very
nicely."</p>

<p>With a quick twist of his arm, the
bachelor dropped a newspaper within
and rising bowed, a gallant little figure
of a gentleman framed in the lamp-glow.</p>

<p>"Allow me to present your Ladyship
with one of my papers!" he said courteously.</p>

<p>"And allow me to thank you for it!"
interposed Aunt Cheerful gently.</p>

<p>Again the boy raised his tattered cap
and smiled, a grave little smile for all
its brightness.</p>

<p>"Good night, Lady Cheerful!" he said.</p>

<p>"Good night, Lord Chesterfield and
remember&mdash;any time your bachelor life
grows too lonely&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lord Chesterfield was off into the
shadows of the dripping lane, whistling
as cheerily as a robin.</p>

<p>Aunt Cheerful turned to the mystified
guest at her fireside.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," she exclaimed gratefully,
"how very tactful of you to make
no sound. The presence of a stranger
would have confused him so! Just a
little game we play each night, Lord
Chesterfield and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What a dear little lad he is!" exclaimed
Jean.</p>

<p>Aunt Cheerful bent and turned the
dying log.</p>

<p>"A kindly, courteous little gentleman,
ever-mindful of my poor lame foot;" she
said thoughtfully, "with his proud, boyish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
heart afire with dreams&mdash;dreams of
becoming a very great doctor and a gallant
gentleman. Why, my dear, his
father was such a queer hermit who lived
with this little son of his in a ruined
shack along the river, a ragged, handsome,
silent man of very great culture,
'twas said, and this fall when he died the
boy refused to leave his crazy hut. A
chore here and a chore there, so he lives,
a wee, lovable, busy little hermit, selling
his newspapers, sweeping out the school
and the church, and doctoring all the
sick animals about with arnica and
witch-hazel. To be sure a hundred
friendly eyes in Westowe watch over
him in secret but few dare offer him any
aid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why 'Lord Chesterfield'?"</p>

<p>"I have read him such portions of Lord
Chesterfield as I deemed suitable," replied
Aunt Cheerful, "and we play our
little game at his request that he may
grow familiar with the ways and words
of gentlemen."</p>

<p>And Jean Varian brushed something
away from her long dark lashes that
sparkled suspiciously like a tear. Surely
Aunt Cheerful and gallant Lord Chesterfield
were worth the many, many
miles of the rainy journey!</p>

<p>"And now, my dear, to bed!" suggested
Aunt Cheerful, smiling and with
a busy tap! tap! of her crutch she was
briskly leading the way up the winding
stairway to a room above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A smell of pine, the lighting of a lamp,
the quick crackle of dry wood as Aunt
Cheerful bent over a tiny fire-place, and
Jean uttered a cry of admiration. Pine
cones and branches showered in pattern
across the wall-paper and the carpet;
pine-sprigged chintz covered the old-fashioned
chairs, and from somewhere a
pine pillow gave forth the fragrance of
the winter forest.</p>

<p>"My Pine Bough Bedroom!" exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful delightedly;
"and how glad I am you like it. And
I furnished it so, my dear, in a little
wave of superstition. An old and
wrinkled gypsy was passing through my
lane and when I called her in for a cup
of tea, what do you suppose she said?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
'Kind lady, great happiness will come
to you one day in the heart of the Christmas
pines!' Doubtless an idle phrase
that came to her with the smell of the
pine but I often think of it. Good
night, my dear."</p>

<p>But Jean laid an impetuous hand
upon the old lady's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful," she said gently,
"you have not once asked me my name!"</p>

<p>"Why neither I have, my dear,"
nodded Aunt Cheerful, "but then I fancied
you would tell me yourself if you
wished me to know."</p>

<p>Jean colored hotly.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful," she said hurriedly,
"there are reasons, for a time at least,
why&mdash;why I can not tell you my name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or why I have come to Westowe! Oh,
I do hope you will not misunderstand
me. May I not," she added pleadingly,
"join in name that little group of nobility
to which Lord Chesterfield and
Lady Cheerful belong?"</p>

<p>"Why to be sure, you may!" exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful, smiling. "I
shall call you the Lady Ariel for you
came to me like a beautiful spirit out of
the wind and rain. Good night, dear."</p>

<p>Very thoughtfully, Jean loosened the
shining masses of her dark hair and
brushed it.</p>

<p>"The Lady Ariel!" she mused, smiling.
"And surely as whimsical a guest
as any spirit of the air might be." Absently
the girl's eyes rested upon a book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
exquisitely bound in Levant, on a table
near-by. It bore the title "Songs of
Cheer" and with a smile at the eternal
cheeriness of this chance shelter of hers,
the girl opened it.</p>

<div class='center'>
"To my cheerful little mother,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>read the inscription in a man's bold
handwriting,</div>

<div class='poem'>
"For every line seems a fragrant breath of her.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"<span class="smcap">Robert Loring.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">"Thanksgiving, Nineteen Eleven."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And as the Lady Ariel read, her beautiful
face flamed scarlet, and shaking
queerly, she dropped to her knees by the
snowy bed, all her superb self-possession
gone in a passionate fit of weeping.</p>

<p>Brush! brush! went the dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pines against the window in a ceaseless
monody, and presently this very strange
guest of Aunt Cheerful's raised her head.
Very white and strained her face but her
eyes were shining.</p>

<div class='center'>
"'The leper no longer crouched at his side,'"<br />
</div>

<div class='center'>she quoted softly;</div>

<div class='poem'>
"'But stood before him glorified,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shining and tall and fair and straight</span><br />

<h2>III</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-d.jpg" width="76" height="76" alt="D" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">DAWN etched a shadowy lace of
pine branches across the window
of the Lady Ariel's Pine
Bough Chamber, and with a quick thrill
of realization Jean rose. In the night
the rain had turned to snow, lightly
thatching the ground in white, and
ghost-like through the dawn loomed
Aunt Cheerful's pines, hung with snowy
tippets of ragged fur. From her window,
Jean wonderingly watched a sturdy
little figure appear among the pines below
and halt at the wood-pile where he
busily began to split kindlings, whistling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
very softly to himself and glancing furtively
at the silent cottage. The kindlings
neatly stacked on the cottage
porch, this rosy-cheeked little wood-chopper
of the dawn briskly swept the snow
from the walks and porch, carefully removed
a sodden sheet of paper from the
trim garden, and vanished stealthily
again among the pines.</div>

<p>Now although Lady Ariel was never
quite sure just how it all came about,
night found her still at Pine Tree Cottage,
and again at dawn she watched
Lord Chesterfield at his furtive tasks.
And so, eventually, swept away again
and again by the warmth of Aunt Cheerful's
hospitality, Jean came to linger on
at the cottage in the pines, thrilled unaccountably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by the unquestioning
friendliness of her cheery hostess.</p>

<p>Each night when the mail train came
in, Aunt Cheerful's lamp flashed its
friendly message through the pines; each
night her birdlike voice carried its invitation
into the dark of the lane. And
sometimes it was a weary villager, homing
through the twilight, who answered
her call and sometimes an astonished
stranger lured into the lane by the smell
of the pine and the brightness of her
light. But to all the welcome was the
same. Aunt Cheerful's cosmic hospitality
made no distinctions, and presently
Jean came to know that the fame of Pine
Tree Cottage was county-wide.</p>

<p>And as regularly as the lamp flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
among the pines, so in mid-evening came
Lord Chesterfield with his Lady's mail
and her paper, his courteous queries for
her Ladyship's health and his relishful
exposition of the village news. Brave,
kindly little hermit! Jean's heart
warmed to his boyish gallantry. And
presently when the first constraint had
worn away, Lord Chesterfield's courtly
queries from the window-sill included
the health of the Lady Ariel.</p>

<p>Nights by the fire there was much talk,
too, of the beautiful Lady of the Fireglow
and Jean grew to marvel at the
wealth of love steadily piling up in the
heart of Aunt Cheerful for Son Robert's
sometime wife. As for "Son Robert"
himself, the caress in Aunt Cheerful's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
voice when she spoke his name,
thrilled her guest indescribably. Flying
mother-winged about the night's
sleepy fireglow, there were eloquent
tales of his boyhood daring, of school
days when he had won a Harvard
scholarship, of his brilliant career in the
busy West, but as the days unfolded
their glowing flower of biography, Jean
found that, manlike, despite his untiring
forethought for her comfort, Robert Loring
had undervalued what his mother
longed for most, his presence! that five
thoughtless years had sped busily away
since his last home-coming; years so long
and lonely for the little cripple in Pine
Tree Lane that a quick resentment
flamed loyally up in Jean's awakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
heart and her eyes softened in a new understanding
of the many devices by
which Aunt Cheerful Loring had somehow
contrived to color the barren years.</p>

<p>"But <i>this</i> Christmas," Aunt Cheerful
was wont to finish her eloquent monograph,
"he is surely coming for he has
written so much about it and oh, my
dear!"&mdash;with shining eyes&mdash;"what a
very wonderful Christmas I shall have
indeed!"</p>

<p>Thus, imperceptibly, the strange and
whimsical comradeship of these two
women grew into something stronger,
something so deep and beautiful that the
Lady Ariel's face grew to mirror its imprint.
And Aunt Cheerful, clinging
wistfully to the companionship of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lovable, mysterious guest who had come
straight into her heart from the wind
and rain, deftly lured the Lady Ariel
into lingering.</p>

<p>Came the busy fortnight before Christmas,
and over the snowy ridges peeped
the December sun like the round and
jolly face of the Christmas Saint with his
snow-beard veiling the hills and the
river-valley below. And now with a
merry jingle of sleigh-bells Westowe
awoke to the activities of the season and
Aunt Cheerful's crutch was never so
busy tap! tap! tapping about with endless
plans for "Son Robert's Christmas."
Nights Lord Chesterfield's eyes shone
with suppressed excitement as he courteously
regaled his noble friends with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
village news, and betimes with a wonderful
new glow about her heart, the
Lady Ariel set out one morning for the
busy city to the South upon a tour of
Christmas shopping.</p>

<p>There were many errands, and when
at night-fall tired and happy, Jean hurried
to the station laden with bundles,
the mail train was already traveling leisurely
up the valley. Wherefore this
light-hearted Christmas shopper rode
homeward over the country roads in a
livery sleigh, cheeks aglow with the winter
cold and eyes alive to the still white
beauty of the winter night.</p>

<p>It was already supper-time when the
sleigh turned into Pine Tree Lane and
Jean, entering softly at the rear to surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Aunt Cheerful, halted noiselessly
in the kitchen. For though the room beyond
was quite empty save for the humming
Emperor and the busy swashbuckler
in the fire, Aunt Cheerful was
chatting away to an invisible guest.
And these were the words Lady Ariel
heard:</p>

<p>"A biscuit, Robert?... Certainly.
Oh, I am so sorry Lady Ariel missed her
train. She has grown so fond of my biscuit....
And here, my dear boy, is
your favorite jam.... Robert," she
said wistfully, "I do so wish you could
grow to love my beautiful Lady Ariel.
Each day she grows more lovely. She
is so quick and sweet and tireless, so
ever-mindful of my comfort and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
poor lame foot.... And do you know,
Robert, I can not help thinking that with
her wonderful gray eyes and the shining
masses of her dark hair, she must be very
like my Lady in the Fire.... To be
sure, Robert, you are right as always....
It is true that I have never seen the
face in the fireglow but I would so like
that daughter of my dreams to be like my
dear, dear Lady Ariel.... No! No!
Robert, I do not know who she is.... I
will not ask her that.... Surely she
will tell me in her own good time if she
wishes me to know. And, besides, has
she not asked me to trust her?... And
Robert, it is so very odd. Though she
has the white and beautiful hands of a
princess with never a mark of toil upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them, yet she has scrubbed and swept
and ironed and baked for me as busily as
a farmer's daughter. She is so quick to
learn, so gentle and tactful&mdash;Oh, Robert!"&mdash;her
voice shook with a little sob&mdash;"I'm
altogether a very foolish old woman
but I've grown to love her so that I can
not let her go out of my life as swiftly
and strangely as she came into it. If
only you would come and help me keep
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the Lady Ariel was gone, out into
the shadows of the pines, the hot tears
raining down her face.</p>

<p>And late that night a telegram went
singing over the wires to Denver, a telegram
having to do with a flame-colored
satin and a case of jewels.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>IV</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="79" height="76" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">FROM Aunt Cheerful's kitchen
came the sound of a woman
singing, of footsteps, quick and
light, and presently of a pleasant call
through the doorway into the room beyond.</div>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady Ariel?"</p>

<p>"I've polished the Emperor until he
fairly illumines the kitchen!"</p>

<p>"My dear, you pamper him <i>too</i> much!"</p>

<p>"And I've made the salad for supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bless your dear, generous heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
child!" exclaimed Aunt Cheerful.
"You're too good. Now come help me
string cranberries for the chapel tree.
I'm sure you'll find it restful after such
a busy hour in the kitchen."</p>

<p>So by the window the Lady Ariel and
Aunt Cheerful gaily made crimson
chains for a Christmas tree until the purple
of the twilight gathered among the
pines and the swaggerer in the fire awoke
to fight the gathering shadows with his
busy sword of flame. By the window
Jean stared absently out at the fading
pines.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady Ariel."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/facing064.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="two women talking" />
<div class="caption">So by the window the Lady Ariel and Aunt Cheerful
gaily made crimson chains for a Christmas tree.</div>
</div>

<p>"How wonderfully tranquil it all is
here. See, it is beginning to snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
White and drifting feathers of peace,
I'm sure! Oh, Aunt Cheerful," she said
with a little sigh, "how much I envy
you!"</p>

<p>"Envy me, Lady Ariel?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Your cottage and your pines
and the quiet of this dear old lane.
Somehow I have grown to love it all!
And then all your friends here in Westowe."</p>

<p>"But surely, child, you too have
friends!"</p>

<p>"Not so sincere and loyal as yours,
Aunt Cheerful. And then you have
Lord Chesterfield and your&mdash;your son in
the West and I have no one."</p>

<p>"No one!"</p>

<p>"No one!" Jean repeated. "Never a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
kinsman even, save a nomadic uncle
with a strain of gipsy blood in his veins
and even he faded out of my life like all
the others years ago. It&mdash;it is a very
odd thing, Aunt Cheerful, to be quite
alone, and sometimes it is very, very
lonely."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Lady Ariel!" exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful in real distress. "I am
so sorry!" For an impetuous instant a
question seemed to hover upon her lips,
then with a quick movement of decision
she was tap-tapping about the room,
lighting the lamp and drawing the
shades.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Lady Ariel!" she exclaimed,
smiling. "You're not in your
usual good spirits to-night! We'll set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the Emperor to singing and have our
tea!"</p>

<p>But Jean's depression lingered and so
it was that when Lord Chesterfield
peered into her shadowy corner by the
fire that night, her chair was empty.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Lady Cheerful!" he
said, disappointment in his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, good evening, Lord Chesterfield.
Dear, dear! your Lordship's cap
is full of snow!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing, madam, I assure you!
I trust your Ladyship is well?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed."</p>

<p>"And the Lady Ariel?"</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Aunt Cheerful hesitated&mdash;"a little
quiet and tired, I should say.
She has gone up to bed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Into Lord Chesterfield's eyes leaped a
sudden excitement.</p>

<p>"A 'normous box came by express," he
burst forth breathlessly, "and it was full
up of spensive, glittery Christmas things
for the chapel tree and&mdash;and&mdash;a letter
came from a candy man and he said a
strange lady'd bought and paid for
s'ficient candy and oranges and&mdash;and
everything for mos' everybody in Westowe
to be delivered at the Sunday
School day before Christmas and&mdash;and
presents came on ahead in a box 'cause
they won't spoil waitin' and&mdash;and nobody
knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Lord Chesterfield,"
broke in Aunt Cheerful in alarm, "do,
<i>do</i>, my dear boy, take a breath!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who sent 'em!" finished Lord Chesterfield.
"And Grandmother Radcliffe
she reckons maybe Lady Ariel is a princess
in disguise and she sent 'em."</p>

<p>"A princess in disguise!" exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful. "Dear, dear, that would
be strange!"</p>

<p>"And maybe," went on Lord Chesterfield
in growing excitement, "maybe
your Ladyship will rec'lect how my dog
medicines were gettin' pretty low and
owin' to er&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;" His Lordship
cleared his throat with a prodigious
"Hum!&mdash;I beg your Ladyship's pardon
but&mdash;er&mdash;were financial embarrassments
just the words you told me that time?"</p>

<p>"Financial embarrassment!" nodded
Aunt Cheerful gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Owing to my financial embarrassments
I couldn't buy more till after
Christmas and&mdash;and this morning,
ma'am, there was an express package for
me with witch-hazel and arnica and
sponges and liniments and bandages and
mos' a reg'lar doctor's outfit in it. Mos'
likely I'll 'speriment on Carlo's rheumatism
to-night with a new liniment."</p>

<p>"Now I do wonder," mused Aunt
Cheerful absently, "if your mysterious
friend could possibly be the one who
keeps my garden so trim and chops my
kindlings. Dear, dear! What a very
strange and mysterious place Westowe
has become!"</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield's fine little face colored
hotly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hardly think they are the same,"
he owned honestly; then, quick contrition
in his eyes, he vaulted lightly over
the window sill and drew a letter from
his pocket. "Oh, Lady Cheerful," he
apologized, "I do beg your Ladyship's
pardon. Fact is, I&mdash;I mos' forgot your
letter!"</p>

<p>"Why, bless your heart, child," exclaimed
Aunt Cheerful warmly, "who
wouldn't forget a letter with such a
magic box on his mind! Your Lordship
will pardon me if I read it this very
minute? It's from my son!" And Lord
Chesterfield bowed a courtly acquiescence.</p>

<p>So with swift color in her cheeks, Aunt
Cheerful read, but as she read her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
began to tremble and suddenly the
letter fluttered unheeded to the floor and
a great tear rolled slowly down her face
and splashed on the white woolen gown.
And even as he watched, his grave little
face perturbed, the mantle of formal
courtesy vanished and Lord Chesterfield
sprang forward, a kindly little lad alive
with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Cheerful," he blurted boyishly,
"I'm <i>awfully</i> sorry!"</p>

<p>But with a muffled sob Aunt Cheerful
patted his arm, taking refuge in the
words of the game they played.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is nothing at all, Lord Chesterfield,
I assure you!" she said bravely.</p>

<p>"My busy son writes me that&mdash;that after
all he can not come for Christmas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>But even as she bent to regain the letter,
she began trembling and crying
again so pitifully that Lord Chesterfield's
face colored darkly and for all he
bit his lips like the brave little fighter
he was at all times, still a great sob
welled up in his own throat and his eyes
grew gentle. And presently in the quiet,
Aunt Cheerful felt the diffident touch
of a boyish hand upon her shoulder and
looking up met the eyes of the little hermit,
oddly resolute for all their sympathy.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful," said he firmly, "I&mdash;I'm
'fraid I'd better stay here all night.
Fact is," with a squaring of chin and
shoulders, "I feel that you'd better have
a man in the house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>But Aunt Cheerful's wan smile bore
in it something resolute of her old
cheeriness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear boy," she exclaimed
gratefully, "it is more than good of you
to offer, but you must remember poor
Carlo's rheumatism and the new liniment
and all the responsibilities of your
bachelor life. And anyway I'm quite
alright now. Silly old women have such
spells."</p>

<p>So presently, after a deal of urging,
Lord Chesterfield departed and Aunt
Cheerful went tap! tap! tapping softly
out into the kitchen to mix her bread.
And even as she worked, a perturbed little
sentinel with a round boyish face
peered furtively in at the kitchen window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
loath to leave the cottage among
the pines when sorrow lay upon it.</p>

<p>Now as Aunt Cheerful worked she began
to sing, and the song was one that
had often bolstered her waning courage
before. And surely in the very words of
it lay the fragrance of her own resourceful
cheeriness.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There is ever a song somewhere, my dear;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the midnight black or the midday blue;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The robin pipes when the sun is here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the cricket chirrups the whole night through.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The buds may blow and the fruit may grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the Autumn leaves drop crisp and sere;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But whether the sun or the rain or the snow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There is ever a song somewhere, my dear."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Whereat, hearing the cheerful song of
his honored lady, a great relief shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
suddenly in Lord Chesterfield's anxious
eyes, and whistling softly to himself he
disappeared among the pines.</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-b.jpg" width="77" height="76" alt="B" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">BUT to-night as Lord Chesterfield
hurried down through the
quiet of the village to his
weather-beaten shack along the river,
his whistle grew slightly erratic and
presently ceased altogether, and when
at last he removed the rusty key from
the nail by the door, his shining eyes and
grim little chin betokened an unusual
excitement and determination.</div>

<p>In the single room of his shanty Lord
Chesterfield lit his lamp, and truly light
never fell upon a stranger boyhood shelter.
For the hermit's rude bed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
neatly made and the floor as neatly
swept, his battered cookstove polished
and the medicine bottles upon his
rickety table ranged in a careful row.
And once the busy hermit had raked his
fire into a bright and warming glow, for
all its lonely rattling when the wind
blew, the river shanty was as snug and
neat a place as one might find.</p>

<p>Now as Lord Chesterfield bustled energetically
about the fire, there came a
whining and a scratching at the shanty
door and, as he opened it, a huge dog
limped slowly in with a joyous bark of
greeting. With ready affection in his
eyes, the hermit bent and patted the
shaggy brown head of his visitor, for
this was Carlo, the toll-gate keeper's old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and rheumatic pensioner, who nightly
limped up the tow-path to be properly
bathed and petted. And the dialogue of
the gallant Doctor and his patient-in-chief
barely varied.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Carlo!" (very brisk
and professional).</p>

<p>A joyous bark.</p>

<p>"And how is the rheumatism to-night?"</p>

<p>A very great wagging of a very bushy
tail but a bark of considerable uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Hum! Well, well, we'll have to attend
to that. Step right over this way
if you please!" And the Doctor, frowning
portentously, bathed Carlo's flank
ever so gently, with now and then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
kindly word of reassurance. These
medical attentions properly completed,
Carlo, whose sense of professional etiquette
was none too keen, fell to nosing
frankly about the hut until he found a
certain plate of scraps, and having
neatly attended to this single spot of disorder,
he limped back to the hermit and
suggestively lowered his handsome head.
Whereupon the Doctor removed a very
small package tied to his collar and
grandly bowed his patient to the door.</p>

<p>A blast of wind rattled the shanty as
Carlo departed. On tiptoe the hermit
locked the door, carefully drew the
shades, and with infinite caution removed
a plank from the floor. Very
furtively he drew forth a dirty canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
bag, pitifully small for all its pleasant
clink and unwrapped Carlo's package, a
coin which Carlo's kindly master nightly
sent for Carlo's fee. Then together with
such coins as he could spare from the
day's proceeds this provident little hermit
hid them all away again in the canvas
bag beneath the plank, for this was
the hidden hoard that Lord Chesterfield
fancied would one day make him a very
great doctor.</p>

<p>And as the final task of the busy evening,
the hermit wrote a letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class='right'>
"December 18th.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<i>Dear Mr. Robert Loring</i>:</div>

<p>"She got your letter and cried and she
most alwus never cries so shaky, Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Cheerful Loring I mean. Oh, please <i>do</i>
come! She feels so awful bad and once
when I was awful sick this winter she
lived three days in this old shanty here
with me and sat up all night account of
medacines and no other bed and she read
me every day bout Lord Chesterfield and
I'd like to do something big for her she's
so awful brave and so awful lame.
Sometimes like to-night when I looked
in the winda she sings to keep her spirits
up. Oh, please, please Mr. Loring,
can't we maybe surprise her for Christmas?
I do most everything I can for her
but just one thing you could do would
be more than all. Five years is awful
long. Most likely you won't know who
I am unless she wrote. She calls me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Lord Chesterfield and lots of folks here
call me Doc and the hermut but, sir, I
have the honer to sine myself&mdash;</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Norman Varian</span>."<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>For so Lord Chesterfield fancied his
illustrious namesake might finish such a
letter.</p>

<p>And as he sealed the letter, the boy
looked wistfully up at a ragged photograph
of his dead father tacked carefully
above the table and very slowly he read
aloud the single line of writing beneath
it.</p>

<p>"Always remember, little son," it read,
"that first of all, though you've seen
hard times, you're a gentleman!"</p>

<p>And suddenly Lord Chesterfield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
brave little head went forward upon his
hands with a choking sob, for after all
he was only a proud and lonely little
bachelor who had greatly loved his
father.</p>

<p>So the little hermit's letter went forth
upon a Christmas mission to come to its
final goal in a luxurious suite of offices
in Denver on the desk of Robert Loring.
And Robert Loring read the eloquent
plea with unwonted color in his face and
a startled shame in his fine eyes, for, unconsciously
vivid, the boy's letter had
strikingly bared the inner life of his
brave and cheerful mother.</p>

<p>"Five years!" said Robert Loring
aghast. "It can't be!"</p>

<p>But swiftly reviewing the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
crowded with activity he knew that the
little hermit had written the truth, and
he flushed again. For the thought of his
mother's lonely life in Pine Tree Lane
subtly dwarfed the urgent calls of effort
and ambition which had kept him from
her. A giant hand of rebuke indeed that
Lord Chesterfield had wielded.</p>

<p>So, swiftly over the night wires went
a telegram to one Norman Varian, and
even as Robert Loring wrote the lad's
name, he stared at it very thoughtfully.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">MILDLY the Christmas moon
rose over Westowe, silvering
the snowy hill-gables to the
north and the covered bridge; trailing a
snow-white ribbon of light through Pine
Tree Lane, and mantling the cottage
among the pines with the peaceful moon-fire
of a Christmas Eve.</div>

<p>And up through the snow-sparkle of
the steep moon-lit path to the chapel on
the hill climbed Aunt Cheerful Loring,
helped ever so gently upward by the
sturdy arm of gallant Lord Chesterfield.
Snow-sparkle and a Christmas moon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the sound of the chapel organ through
the lighted windows above! What
wonder that all of it lured Aunt Cheerful
to climb as she had never climbed
before, with scarcely a thought for the
poor lame foot.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Lady Cheerful!" begged
the boy gently.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Lord Chesterfield,"
urged Aunt Cheerful with a brisk tap!
tap! of her crutch, "I can not possibly
miss any of this wonderful Christmas
celebration for which you have worked
so busily and&mdash;hear! already they are
singing the Christmas hymn!"</p>

<p>Down through the cold air from the
moonlit chapel above came the sound of
a reverent chorus chanting "Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Night," and Lord Chesterfield's brown
eyes glowed strangely.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is only the song service they
have beforehand," he said re-assuringly,
"for&mdash;for to-night, Aunt Cheerful," he
added with smothered excitement, "they
can't begin without me!"</p>

<p>Pine and holly and tinsel and gifts,
so they loomed ahead as Lord Chesterfield
led his honored lady to her pew
and bent over her with a flame of color
in his smooth, young cheeks.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cheerful," he stammered excitedly,
"I&mdash;I beg your Ladyship's pardon
but&mdash;but will you please 'scuse me
now. I&mdash;I've got a mos' important errand!"</p>

<p>Primly the hermit had climbed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
chapel hill with his lady, but now with
never a backward look he raced madly
down the path and through the village
to the railroad station, a flushed and
panting youngster trembling with excitement.
Far below where rails and
moonlit sky merged appeared a light and
upon its steadily growing disk Lord
Chesterfield fixed his eyes in a fever of
fascination. Chug-a-chug! Chug-a-chug!
Chug-a-chug! How desperately
slow it crept up through the snow-silver
of the valley! And how wildly the hermit's
glowing heart pounded away beneath
his Sunday suit!</p>

<p>On came the train at last and halted,
and presently Lord Chesterfield was
hurrying excitedly down the platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
toward a man, young and tall, whose
handsome eyes were surely of a most
familiar blue. Gravely the little hermit
raised his cap and bowed.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" he ventured sturdily
"Are you&mdash;are you Mr. Robert
Loring?"</p>

<p>"Robert Loring, indeed!" answered
the young man gravely; "and very much
at your service." And his eyes were
gentle as he held out his hand. "And
you, I take it, are Lord Chesterfield himself.
Well, sir, I'm glad to know you."</p>

<p>Now there was such an earnest ring
of respect and deference in this young
man's pleasant voice that Lord Chesterfield
colored with pleasure. So, very
gravely, these two shook hands and, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
finely punctilious, the little hermit
cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"May I," he queried politely&mdash;"may
I&mdash;er&mdash;take you to my&mdash;er&mdash;bachelor
'partments for something to eat first?"</p>

<p>Robert Loring's keen eyes traveled
over the manly figure of his little friend
with never a smile.</p>

<p>"Let me thank your Lordship," he said
gratefully, "but I've already dined.
From now on, sir, my time is yours."</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield grasped his arm in
a spasm of excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, Mr. Robert," he burst forth
in great relief, "I am so awful glad, for
there ain't a single minute to lose. Bill
Flittergill, sir, he went and bust his arm
a while back and oh, sir, will you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to the chapel and take his place and dress
up in the Santa Claus suit and&mdash;give the
presents and&mdash;and when I say like this&mdash;'Lord
Chesterfield's present to Aunt
Cheerful Loring with his respects!' will
you just&mdash;just take off your mask when
she comes up and oh&mdash;sir, <i>will</i> you?"</p>

<p>And Robert Loring rested one hand
very gently on the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Old chap," he said huskily, "I want
you to understand that I leave everything,
absolutely everything to you.
I've managed things long enough and it
seems to me I've made a most astonishing
mess of it!"</p>

<p>So that night in Westowe Chapel a
broad-shouldered Kris Kringle dispensed
the Christmas gifts as the hermit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
directed until the glittering tree was
fairly stripped and the magic box quite
empty, and at last with a hoarse little
quaver in his voice, Lord Chesterfield
came to the final name upon his list.</p>

<p>"Lord Chesterfield's present to Aunt
Cheerful Loring!" he announced with a
gulp, and, coloring with pleasure, Aunt
Cheerful came hurrying up the aisle with
a brisk tap! tap! of her crutch.</p>

<p>"Now, oh, <i>now</i>, Mr. Robert!"
prompted Kris Kringle's agitated helper.
So with a hand that visibly shook, Robert
Loring removed his beard and mask
and stepped from the Christmas shadow
of the pine boughs.</p>

<p>For a tense instant Aunt Cheerful
stared, stared at the smiling face of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
big and gallant son with eyes so wild and
startled that she seemed but a pitiful little
crippled ghost swaying weakly upon
her crutch, then the ever-busy crutch fell
unheeded to the floor and Aunt Cheerful
Loring fell sobbing to her knees, one
trembling out-stretched hand clutching
desperately at the ragged fur on Kris
Kringle's coat as if to keep the dear
apparition from fading away again before
her very eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, oh, my dear boy!" she
cried incoherently. "It&mdash;it was the
Christmas pines as the gipsy said&mdash;"
then in the hush that spread electrically
over the little chapel, she began to shake
and sob and laugh so queerly that Lord
Chesterfield leaped to her side. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Robert Loring, with misty eyes, bent
and gently raised his mother to her feet.</p>

<p>"Brave, brave little mother!" he said
huskily. "I did not know."</p>

<p>Somewhere in the tear-dimmed host
of friends within the chapel, a kindly
voice in a wave of quick consideration
for the tearful little cripple clinging so
pitifully to her son, struck up the Christmas
hymn and once more, that eventful
Christmas Eve, the strains of "Holy
Night" went sweeping out from the hill
chapel over the moonlit snow.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">MEANWHILE in the Pine
Bough Bedroom, Jean was
writing a letter.</div>

<p>"My maid, Celeste, has forwarded to
me your letter," she wrote, "and now
when I know that I must write you where
I am and why I have come here, that at
last I must answer your insistent question,
oh, Robert!&mdash;it is very hard indeed.</p>

<p>"How mockingly to-night your words
are ringing in my ears!</p>

<p>"'And so,' you said that memorable
night, 'it is but right for me to tell you
now, Jean, that with marriage, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
grant me that happiness, my brave and
lonely little mother comes back into my
home-life for all time!'</p>

<p>"Very handsome and very resolute you
looked, but Robert, I wonder if you
guessed what a queer resentful chill
crept into my selfish heart at your words.
Like a grim leper stalking at my side
rose the thought that once more Life was
ironically robbing me of its finest and
sweetest. Oh, Robert, how can I write
you now that I did not want your mother
in my home and life, intruding upon the
first happiness of my lonely life&mdash;that I
wanted only you!</p>

<p>"I asked you to wait without seeing
me again until I should write you and
with Celeste's connivance I slipped away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the night, bent upon the maddest,
crudest whim that ever selfish heart devised.
For I came to the little village
you had so often described&mdash;to Westowe&mdash;and
I came&mdash;yes, I must write it all
crude and narrow as it is&mdash;to appraise,
to coldly analyze and dissect&mdash;your
mother, to see if I deemed her <i>worthy</i>
a place in my home and my new life with
you! And out of the rain and dark,
Fate's twinkling light lured me to her
very door!</p>

<p>"For, Robert, I am here in the dear
peace and quiet of this pine-scented
lane, unknown, unquestioned, trusted
as I surely do not deserve, lingering on
day by day with this dear, brave little
mother of yours, and now I know that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
is I who am not worthy, that my very
quest was a profanation that makes my
cheeks burn with the utter shame of it.
And something has stirred in my lonely
heart at the sight of her that has been
hushed since early childhood. So often
these days I find myself repeating those
wonderful words of Lowell's:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The leper no longer crouched at his side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But stood before him glorified,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shining and tall and fair and straight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate.</span><br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the Voice that was calmer than silence said</span><br />
"Lo, it is I, be not afraid!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In many climes, without avail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Behold it is here."'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"So the leper of selfish resentment no
longer crouches at my side. Instead
there is something so shining and beautiful
that I grow afraid. 'In many climes
without avail!' And even that is I,
Egypt and India and Syria and the uttermost
parts of the world, so in a mad
search for life I have gone and gone
again and here in the heart of the pines
I have found life and peace and love,
the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>"After all, Robert, how much of life's
heart-glow I have been denied until now.
Those black and bitter childhood days,
the under-current of resentment because
the only heir to the Varian millions was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not a boy, the tearless agony of the
nights when first divorce and later death
took my father and mother out of my
life and I cried for sisters, for brothers,
for cousins, for anything in God's world
to give some touch of humanness to my
barren life&mdash;such is my cycle of memory.
I wonder if you can guess the utter desolation
that comes with the knowledge
that you are quite alone with never a
single blood-tie to warm the ice about
your heart.</p>

<p>"But, now, I have worked with my
hands. I have scrubbed and ironed and
baked, I have lived for another besides
myself, I have watched the lives of two
whose brave and cheerful compassion
for each other bears in it the touch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
holiness and I have come to know a wee
soldier whose sturdiness on life's firing
line, like that of your mother, has
shamed me again and again. Such a
wonderfully courteous little lad he is,
Robert, with his hermit hut and his
buried savings and his dreams of becoming
a very great doctor. And some day
when I can devise a way of breaking
through the wall of his pride, I am going
to make him what he dreams. Robert,
I think the ice is melting around my
heart at last. I am gaining a broader
vision.</p>

<p>"Lady Ariel&mdash;it is so Aunt Cheerful
calls me. Oh, Robert, how can I go to
her and tell her why I came, how I linger
here day by day hoping for courage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ask her pardon. And it has grown even
harder now that I know that she would
have the kind and beautiful wife of her
son like Lady Ariel, that she has whimsically
chosen to see in me her fanciful
Lady of the Fireglow garbed wondrously
in flame-colored satin! For
how can I let her glimpse the cruel
canker that lay in the heart of the daughter
of her dreams. On the bed as I write
lies a gown of 'flame-colored satin' and
the Varian jewels, and this moonlit
Christmas Eve when she comes from the
chapel, I shall go to her as she has
dreamed of me and on my knees I shall
beg her forgiveness and a place in the
beautiful shrine of her brave and cheerful
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, pray for me that I may
not hurt her!"</p>

<p>Very thoughtfully Jean sealed the
letter and directed it to Robert Loring,
then she began a brisk pilgrimage about
the quiet house. Holly and mistletoe
and Christmas wreaths came mysteriously
to light from a box beneath the
Lady Ariel's bed, and soon the cottage
among the pines smiled cheerfully
through a Christmas flare of pine and
holly. For Aunt Cheerful's Christmas
interest had somehow waned after Robert's
letter, and at the hermit's diffident
suggestion, Lady Ariel had taken the
pleasant task upon herself.</p>

<p>And when the deft and busy decorator
had finished her work, she slipped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her cloak and went hurrying through the
village toward the covered bridge.
Very lonely and small the hermit's hut
in the moonlight and with a catch in her
throat, Jean took the rusty key from the
nail and entered. Only Aunt Cheerful
and Lady Ariel knew the secret of the
buried savings. So to-night Jean hurriedly
searched the hermit's floor for a
certain creaking board, and when at last
she drew forth the pitiful little canvas
bag, she stuffed it full of greenbacks.</p>

<div class="caption">Jean drew forth the pitiful little canvas bag and stuffed

</div>

<p>The chill silver of the winter moonlight
flooded brightly through the open
door, haloing the figure of the girl upon
her knees in the desolate shanty and
flashing full upon the ragged photograph
above the table. So as Jean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
turned, her startled eyes rested directly
upon the features of the hermit's father,
and the girl stared aghast, her face white
in the moonlight. For the face was the
face of her nomad Uncle whose life had
been irrevocably marred by the cruelty
of her father. And as Jean stared,
somewhere within her the ice melted for
all time. Starved and eager strands of
kinsmanship went flying out to twine
hungrily about the gallant heart of Lord
Chesterfield, and there upon her knees
in the river shack, the heiress to the
Varian millions fell to sobbing and
praying incoherently for the love of her
little cousin. And even as she prayed,
faintly over the village came the echo of
the Christmas hymn.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">INTENT in the kitchen upon
the preparation of a little surprise
supper for Aunt Cheerful
and the hermit, Jean had not heard the
opening of the cottage door and therefore
when a man's pleasant voice broke
in upon her thoughts, she started so violently
that the spoon in her hand went
clattering to the floor.</div>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Robert Loring,
"but my mother bade me tell the
Lady Ariel that she has gone with Hiram
Scudder to carry the chapel's Christmas
gifts to the poor of Westowe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>But oddly enough there was no answer
at all from the white-aproned worker in
his mother's kitchen, moreover she did
not even turn her head and a little puzzled,
Robert Loring raised his voice.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he began again
and halted&mdash;for Lady Ariel had turned
as he spoke with a wistful smile of
apology about her lips.</p>

<p>Unutterable astonishment flamed up
in Robert Loring's eyes, but he did not
speak, for there was something in Jean's
face that somehow made the power of
words depart. In a queer silence they
faced each other, Robert Loring's memory
flashing back to the night at the
opera when he had first seen this girl before
him in the white and silver of trailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
satin, when the beautiful chill and
bitterness of her eyes had left their imprint
upon his soul for eternity. There
were no shadows in her eyes to-night;
and smoothing away the lines of soul-rebellion,
a new strength and sweetness
lay wistfully about her mouth. Ruffled
hair and toil-marked hands! With a
sudden bound, Robert Loring caught the
girl's hands within his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jean, Jean!" he cried wonderingly,
"what does it all mean? Celeste
would not tell me where you had gone."
But Jean slipped from his arms with a
laugh that was half a sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no! Robert," she said
bravely, "you must read your letter first
and know me for what I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>So by the kitchen window, Robert Loring
read his letter and when he finished
his eyes were very thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Jean, dear," he said gently, "there
is much for which you and I must one
day beg my little mother's pardon but
surely you have not erred so much as I."</p>

<p>By the fireglow with the Emperor
humming a festive prediction of tea for
the Christmas supper, Robert Loring
heard the story of Lady Ariel's whimsical
journey and its climax in the hermit's
hut, but when the jingle of sleigh-bells
outside announced the halting of
Hiram Scudder's sleigh Jean went flying
happily from the room and up the stairs.
With a tap! tap! tapping! of the
crutch&mdash;never so brisk and cheerful as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to-night, Aunt Cheerful presently entered
upon the arm of the gallant hermit.</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, my dear boy!" she exclaimed
happily. "How very like my
dear Lady Ariel to surprise me with all
this glow of holly and the Christmas
wreaths. You can not imagine how
cheerily they smiled at me through the
pines! And dear me, bless the child's
heart, the table is set for a little supper
and the Emperor singing a Christmas
hymn. Never, never was there such another
Christmas since the world began."</p>

<p>But Robert Loring drew his mother
to a seat by the fire and gently began to
tell her something of the wife who was
to come at last into his mother's life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
his own, and somehow as he talked Aunt
Cheerful grew very quiet and a little
sad and presently she turned quite
around that she might not look into the
fireglow for since Lady Ariel's coming
she had made wistful plans of her own
about Son Robert's wife and the fireglow
mocked her with the impotency of
them all. And when a quick step on the
stairway betokened the return of Lady
Ariel, a great tear rolled slowly down
Aunt Cheerful's face and turning she
fell back in her chair with a cry of awe.</p>

<p>For surely so radiant a Christmas vision
never stood framed in a holly-crowned
doorway before. Flame-colored
satin trailed about the Lady Ariel's
slender figure; diamonds flashed about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
her throat and hair. And as she gasped
and stared, first at the eloquent eyes of
her son and then at the Christmas vision
in the doorway, Aunt Cheerful Loring
knew the truth. With a wild tapping of
her crutch she went flying swiftly across
the quiet room.</p>

<p>"Oh, my beautiful Lady of the Fireglow!"
she cried, sobbing for the very
joy of it all. "My dear, dear Lady
Ariel!"</p>

<p>And Lord Chesterfield, kindly little
courtier that he was, began briskly to
poke the fire that he might not be an
outside witness to this Christmas scene
of joy and reunion, but a great loneliness
swept over him and all the while he
was stirring up the sleepy swashbuckler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the fire he was swallowing manfully.
So in his tearful abstraction the hermit
did not know that Jean's eyes were full
upon him or that with a soft rustle of the
flame-colored satin she had crossed the
room and seated herself beside him.</p>

<p>"Lord Chesterfield," said Jean gently,
"all these wonderful days you have not
once told me your Lordship's name."</p>

<p>"Why, why, no, Lady Ariel," stammered
the boy in quick apology, "I
haven't. I do beg your Ladyship's pardon.
It is Norman Varian."</p>

<p>"Norman Varian!" repeated Jean.
"It is a very familiar name, your Lordship."</p>

<p>Smiling Lady Ariel slipped a paper
into the hermit's hand. And these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the very astonishing words the paper
bore:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I hereby pledge myself by the memory of
my dead uncle, Norman Varian, to make of
my brave little cousin a gentleman and a
scholar and a very great Doctor.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"Christmas eve.     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    <span class="smcap">Jean Varian.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>And when Lord Chesterfield reached
the familiar surname at the end, he knew
why Lady Ariel's beautiful face had
haunted his dreams&mdash;it was a face very
like the face of his dead father; moreover
he knew why the look in the girl's
gray eyes had so hurt his throat for, unlike
his own, they were Varian eyes.
And as the brave little hermit slowly
came to realize that in this lonely world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
he was not quite alone, that here were
kindly eyes that had the right of kinsmanship
to watch over his sturdy climb
to manhood, his pride and independence
ruthlessly deserted him and he dropped
on his knees and buried his face in Jean's
lap, a forlorn little lad unnerved at the
end of a gallant fight.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cousin Jean," he blurted with a
great sob, "I been so awful lonely 'specially
when the wind blew nights and I
missed daddy so and&mdash;and the canvas
bag's been fillin' so awful slow and mos'
every rain there was a new leak&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jean stroked her cousin's hair with a
hand that trembled a little.</p>

<p>Now in the silence that fell over the
room, the wrathful Emperor burst suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
into a perfect bubble of ferocity.
He steamed and he hissed and he bubbled
and grumbled, he fumed at the
mouth and rattled his helmet and tossed
his plume of steam about in an imperial
rage, for when had royalty been so persistently
ignored as on this Christmas
Eve! And presently as the four sat
down to the Christmas supper, through
the moonlit pines came the sound of the
chapel bell ringing in a Christmas morning.</p>
